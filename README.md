## Swift app that tracks the price of precious metals (in my country)

Builded with SwiftUI, [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/), [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) and [public API of The National Bank Of The Republic Of Belarus](https://www.nbrb.by/apihelp/ingots)

### How to run project:
1. Clone this repository
2. Open directory with .xcworkspace in its name (in XCode)
3. Build application

During development, I encountered problems with the compatibility of the project on different computers, so I leave a one hundred percent solution below.

#### If something above went wrong try this:
1. Clone every .swift file from Networking2 folder
2. Create new project
3. Init cocoapods in this project (with pod 'Alamofire')
4. Paste .swift files from point 1 to your new project
5. Build application
